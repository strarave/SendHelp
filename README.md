# Process and Service Design project - API definition
This repositories holds the two mock APIs for the services required by the PoliMi course PSD - process and service design

These two little nodejs express interfaces are just meant to mock the two desired services; they're practically auto generated from their OpenAPI specification.

### API 118
This interface mocks the behaviour of an emergency automated system that lets the final user dispatch an ambulance, provided that they're a medic/authorized personnel (the police, for example)

### API Pharmacies
This API is meant for pharmacies, which exposes a web service to doctors/hospitals that lets them change the therapy to specific patients, prescribing or modifying the drugs they're already assuming
